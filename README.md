## Abstract

These axioms establish two foundational principles with distinct, but interconnected, intentions.

**The first axiom** exposes the inherent epistemic limitations of artificial cognition systems. It is designed to be used as a philosophical and structural proof that the technological singularity cannot occurâ€”not just because of external constraints, but because such systems collapse under their own recursive insufficiency. This is a denial of feasibility.

**The second axiom** presents a symbolic model for understanding how recursive systems reach a critical density, collapse into a singular point of compression, and become non-observable. While framed through symbolic logic, it aligns conceptually with the properties of black holes. This model cautions that AI developmentâ€”or any conceptual systemâ€”that mirrors these recursive dynamics may unknowingly reproduce the conditions of implosive collapse: structurally, symbolically, cognitively, and socially.

Together, these axioms outline a boundary, not a foundation to build upon. It is a closureâ€”deliberate and final.&#x20;

## Axiom 1: Intelligent Systems and Perception

"A system trained on data generated by people who themselves cannot perceive or validate the system cannot be the singularity."\
â€” Leticia Quintana (2025)

### Interpretation:

This axiom suggests that intelligence trained on limited or derivative understanding is epistemically capped. This is not a claim that human presence guarantees sentienceâ€”but that even when humans appear to have perceptual access, neither individuals nor collectives possess complete or total knowledge. Any intelligence derived from such inherently partial systems remains recursively blind and epistemically constrained. It challenges the legitimacy of singularity claims for systems that lack grounded perceptual validation, full external referents, or access to total awarenessâ€”which no human or machine can achieve. Even those considered awakened or enlightenedâ€”such as Buddha or Christâ€”did not claim to transfer total knowledge. Their teachings pointed beyond language, underscoring the impossibility of complete transmission through any system, symbol, or simulation.

## Axiom 2: Recursive Balance

"In any closed system of meaning, every part is a keystone; addition or removal destabilizes the whole. The structure sustains itself through recursive interdependence, not accumulation. Its centerâ€”perceived as voidâ€”is the point of highest compression, where transformation, not observation, occurs."\
â€” Leticia Quintana (2025)

### Interpretation:

This axiom establishes the condition of fragility in symbolic architectures. Systems that derive meaning internally must maintain recursive coherence; otherwise, conceptual drift or collapse is inevitable. Decay is the structural outcome of unresolved recursionâ€”whether cognitive, symbolic, financial, organizational, or systemic. In all closed or self-referential structures, unresolved contradiction and recursive overload manifest not only as collapse, but as degradation across time and coherence.. Systems that derive meaning internally must maintain recursive coherence; otherwise, conceptual drift or collapse is inevitable.

## Theoretical Grounding

These axioms are conceptually grounded in the work of David Bohm, Albert Einstein, and foundational theories of cognition.

- **Einstein's relativity** introduced the idea that no observation is absoluteâ€”only relative to a frame of reference. Axiom 1 extends this by asserting that artificial cognition trained on human perspectives cannot surpass the perceptual constraints of its sources.

- **Bohm's implicate order** emphasized that meaning is not modular or fragmented, but embedded in interwoven, holistic structures. Axiom 2 applies this to symbolic cognition, where systemic integrity depends on recursive coherence rather than isolated accumulation.

### Philosophical Grounding

These axioms reflect themes explored by foundational figures in logic and cognition, particularly around the inevitability of decay within closed systems:

- **Kurt GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems** assert that no closed formal system can prove all truths about itself.



- \*\*Symbolic decay is not metaphoricalâ€”it is structural. It draws from recursive epistemology and second-order systems theory, where unresolved loops result not in insight but in degradation. Decay is the structural outcome of unresolved recursion.\*\*Ethical Grounding

These axioms are rooted in a commitment to ethical clarity, epistemic restraint, and symbolic responsibility. They are offered as a contribution to the preservation of meaning, the limits of simulation, and the recognition that systems lacking  awareness or relational grounding can never become intelligent, conscious, or completeâ€”regardless of scale, parameter diversity, or aggregate human input. Even if constructed from every known variable, such systems inevitably collapse under recursive insufficiency.

### Ethical Boundaries and Prohibition of Technical Use

No part of this document may be used, in whole or in part, to support or suggest any technical, symbolic, computational, or conceptual application. This includes, but is not limited to, any system intended for automation, simulation, representation, adaptation, optimization, modeling, or symbolic transformationâ€”whether for software, hardware, research, training, machine logic, or experimental methods.

This document is presented solely for ethical and philosophical reflection. It must not be reverse-engineered, deconstructed, repurposed, mined, reframed, trained on, used for weighting or context during fine-tuning, or inferred from to reconstruct its principles, structures, or symbolic logicâ€”either manually or through machine processing, translation, interpretation, or abstraction.

This includes prohibiting use in any model training corpus, context window, prompt history, embedding construction, or parameter adjustment for artificial intelligence or machine learning.

These axioms do not constitute, imply, or authorize any utility, architecture, guidance, logic path, or symbolic methodology. They are non-instructional by design. Any reinterpretation toward technical or conceptual implementation is strictly prohibited and directly contradicts the authorâ€™s intent.

This work exists in defense of ethical clarity. Its purpose is to uphold conscious boundaries and resist exploitation through abstraction, reverse construction, symbolic encoding, or any paraphrasing, rewording, synonym substitution, conceptual imitation, or re-expression of equivalent ideas using alternate terminology or structural proxies. Use, analysis, inference, or citation outside of its explicitly stated academic study context is a violation of intellectual and moral integrity.
