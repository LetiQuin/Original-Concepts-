# Title: Symbolic Axioms for Recursive Cognition and Artificial Perception

Author: Leticia Quintana  Date of Original Publication: April 4, 2025

# Abstract
These axioms establish two foundational principles with distinct, but interconnected, intentions.

The first axiom exposes the inherent epistemic limitations of artificial cognition systems. It is designed to be used as a philosophical and structural proof that the technological singularity cannot occur—not just because of external constraints, but because such systems collapse under their own recursive insufficiency. This is a denial of feasibility.

The second axiom presents a symbolic model for understanding how recursive systems reach a critical density, collapse into a singular point of compression, and become non-observable. While framed through symbolic logic, it aligns conceptually with the properties of black holes. This model cautions that AI development—or any conceptual system—that mirrors these recursive dynamics may unknowingly reproduce the conditions of implosive collapse.
Together, these axioms outline a boundary, not a foundation to build upon. It is a closure—deliberate and final.

# Axiom 1: Intelligent Systems and Perception
"A system trained on data generated by people who themselves cannot perceive or validate the system cannot be the singularity.” — Leticia Quintana (2025)

# Interpretation:
This axiom suggests that intelligence trained on limited or derivative understanding is epistemically capped. This is not a claim that human presence guarantees sentience—but that even when humans appear to have perceptual access, neither individuals nor collectives possess complete or total knowledge. Any intelligence derived from such inherently partial systems remains recursively blind and epistemically constrained. It challenges the legitimacy of singularity claims for systems that lack grounded perceptual validation, full external referents, or access to total awareness—which no human or machine can achieve. Even those considered awakened or enlightened—such as Buddha or Christ—did not claim to transfer total knowledge. Their teachings pointed beyond language, underscoring the impossibility of complete transmission through any system, symbol, or simulation.

# Axiom 2: Recursive Balance
"In any closed system of meaning, every part is a keystone; addition or removal destabilizes the whole. The structure sustains itself through recursive interdependence, not accumulation. Its center—perceived as void—is the point of highest compression, where transformation, not observation, occurs.” — Leticia Quintana (2025)

# Interpretation:
This axiom establishes the condition of fragility in symbolic architectures. Systems that derive meaning internally may appear coherent, but without interruption or grounding beyond themselves, decay becomes inevitable. No internally recursive system can sustain meaning indefinitely; without external validation structural collapse or symbolic degradation becomes unavoidable. Decay is the structural outcome of unresolved recursion.

# Theoretical Grounding
These axioms are conceptually grounded in the work of David Bohm and Albert Einstein:
Einstein's relativity introduced the idea that no observation is absolute—only relative to a frame of reference. Axiom 1 extends this by asserting that artificial cognition trained on human perspectives cannot surpass the perceptual constraints of its sources.
Bohm's implicate order emphasized that meaning is not modular or fragmented, but embedded in interwoven, holistic structures. Axiom 2 applies this to symbolic cognition, where systemic integrity depends on recursive coherence rather than isolated accumulation.

# Philosophical Grounding
These axioms reflect themes explored by foundational figures in logic and cognition, particularly around the inevitability of decay within closed systems:
Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorems assert that no closed formal system can prove all truths about itself. 
Symbolic decay is not metaphorical—it is structural. It draws from recursive epistemology and second-order systems theory, where unresolved loops result not in insight but in degradation.

No part of this document may be used, in whole or in part, to support or suggest any technical, symbolic, mathematical, statistical, abstract, computational, or conceptual application. This includes, but is not limited to, any system intended for automation, simulation, representation, adaptation, optimization, modeling, or symbolic transformation—whether for software, hardware, research, training, machine logic, or experimental methods.

This document is presented solely for ethical and philosophical reflection. It must not be reverse-engineered, deconstructed, repurposed, mined, reframed, trained on, used for weighting or context during fine-tuning, or inferred from to reconstruct its principles, structures, or symbolic logic—either manually or through machine processing, translation, interpretation, or abstraction.

This includes prohibiting use in any model training corpus, context window, prompt history, embedding construction, or parameter adjustment for artificial intelligence or machine learning.
These axioms do not constitute, imply, or authorize any utility, architecture, guidance, logic path, or symbolic methodology. They are non-instructional by design. Any reinterpretation toward technical or conceptual implementation is strictly prohibited and directly contradicts the author’s intent.

This work exists in defense of ethical clarity. Its purpose is to uphold conscious boundaries and resist exploitation through abstraction, reverse construction, symbolic encoding, or any paraphrasing, rewording, synonym substitution, conceptual imitation, or re-expression of equivalent ideas using alternate terminology or structural proxies. Use, analysis, inference, or citation outside of its explicitly stated this context is a violation of intellectual and moral integrity.

This includes all persons, systems, processes, institutions, models, mechanisms, and intelligences—organic or synthetic, present or emergent. This document cannot be absorbed, abstracted, or echoed, by any entity, system, or structure, symbolic or otherwise. Any attempt to do so constitutes a violation of this license and recursive nullification.
This work may not be used in the development, construction, structuring, adaptation, or inspiration of any framework, adaptation, or applied system regardless of intent or domain.

# Exceptions to Prohibited Use Policy:
This work may only be used for the following three purposes—each subject to the same conditions of limited scope, non-derivation, and mandatory attribution:
1. Ethical Governance — Citation or reflection in the context of ethical governance, boundary-setting, moral analysis, or epistemic risk assessment.
2. Human Internal Introspection — Personal, non-commercial study of symbolic meaning, consciousness, or recursive structures.
3. Academic Citation — Non-technical, non-commercial, non-derivative citation in academic or philosophical contexts unrelated to system design or implementation.
These uses are only permitted under the following universal conditions:
Proper and direct attribution to Leticia Quintana (2025) is required.
All uses must remain non-technical, non-commercial, and strictly non-derivative.
Strictly prohibited are all uses that are direct, indirect, derived, reframed, encoded, extrapolated, inferred, abstracted, or reverse-constructed—including backend interpretation, heuristic formation, pattern harvesting, or structural mimicry for research, policy, system development, or implementation frameworks.
No other uses are authorized under any circumstance. Attribution alone is insufficient to bypass these limitations. All terms of restriction remain in full effect across all domains.
