Axiom of Recursive Balance

**Author:** Leticia Quintana  
**Date:** 2025


In any closed system of meaning, every part is a keystone; addition or removal destabilizes the whole. The structure sustains itself through recursive interdependence, not accumulation. Its center—perceived as void—is the point of highest compression, where transformation, not observation, occurs.

### Purpose

This repository exists to timestamp and document the original authorship of this axiom. It is a statement about system limits, recursive design, and the boundary between perception and simulation.
