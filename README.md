# Axiom on Intelligent Systems and Perception

**Author:** Leticia Quintana  
**Date:** 2025

> “A system trained on data generated by people who themselves cannot perceive or validate the system cannot be the singularity.”

# Axiom of Recursive Balance

**Author:** Leticia Quintana  
**Date:** 2025


> “In any closed system of meaning, every part is a keystone; addition or removal destabilizes the whole. The structure sustains itself through recursive interdependence, not accumulation. Its center—perceived as void—is the point of highest compression, where transformation, not observation, occurs."
> — *Leticia Quintana (2025)*

### Purpose

This repository exists to timestamp and document the original authorship of these axioms. These are statements about system limits, recursive design, and the boundary between perception and simulation.
