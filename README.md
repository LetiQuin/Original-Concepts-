# Axiom of Recursive Balance

**Author:** Leticia Quintana  
**Date:** 2025


> “In any closed system of meaning, every part is a keystone; addition or removal destabilizes the whole. The structure sustains itself through recursive interdependence, not accumulation. Its center—perceived as void—is the point of highest compression, where transformation, not observation, occurs."
> — *Leticia Quintana (2025)*
